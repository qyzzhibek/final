**Q1:** What is the time complexity of BFS on a graph with V vertices and E edges?  
**A:** O(V + E)

**Q2:** What data structure is typically used in DFS?  
**A:** Stack or recursion.

**Q3:** What is an adjacency matrix?  
**A:** A 2D array where cell (i, j) indicates an edge between vertices i and j.

**Q4:** When is BFS better than DFS?  
**A:** When finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**Q5:** What is the difference between a tree and a graph?  
**A:** A tree is an acyclic connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges.
