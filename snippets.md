**Snippet 1: What is a Graph?**
> A graph is a set of vertices and edges that represent relationships between entities.

**Snippet 2: Directed vs Undirected**
> In directed graphs, edges have direction; in undirected, they do not.

**Snippet 3: Adjacency List**
> Stores each vertex with a list of its neighbors. Memory-efficient for sparse graphs.

**Snippet 4: Adjacency Matrix**
> A 2D matrix representing connections. Good for dense graphs.

**Snippet 5: What is BFS?**
> Breadth-first search explores level by level using a queue.

**Snippet 6: What is DFS?**
> Depth-first search goes deep along a path using recursion or a stack.

**Snippet 7: Applications of Graphs**
> Used in networking, maps, scheduling, and more.

**Snippet 8: Weighted vs Unweighted Graphs**
> Weights add cost to edges; affects pathfinding strategies.

**Snippet 9: Connected Graph**
> A graph where every pair of nodes is connected by a path.

**Snippet 10: Cycle in Graph**
> A cycle is a path where the first and last vertices are the same.
